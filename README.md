# SFTP-Checker

Simple piece of GOlang that demonstrates SFTP connectivity. The primary purpose was to investigate use of OpenSSH keys and host key strings in a util coded from the ground up using bare-metal libraries.

Proof-of-concept : It simply searches for a file on an SFTP host and optionally removes it.
